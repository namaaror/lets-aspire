# Description

In v3.0.0, v-f-d is compatible with both decorators API stage 3 and stage 2 now.

# Decorators API stage 3

To enable this, you need to update TypeScript to 5.x and set `compilerOptions.experimentalDecorators` to `false` (value `true` for stage 2). 

> Currently some vue libraries(e.g. Volar) may not compatible with TypeScript 5.x.

# Breaking changes

### Cast class component to vue options API

Using `toNative` to cast a class component to vue options API, after that, the casted component could be used as a native vue component in where vue accepts it.

> Currently `toNative` is not necessary, because v-f-d use a vue internal API, but it is not stable and may missing in the future vue verions. So `toNameve` is recommended.

```typescript
@Component
export class MyComp extends Vue{}
export default toNative(MyComp)

//Code also works currently:
@Component
export default class MyComp extends Vue{}
```

### Depreactate init class property despends on another in constructor

This is not allowed now.
```typescript
@Component({
    name: "MyComponent"
})
export class MyComponent extends Vue {
    @Prop
    prop!: string

    field = this.prop // this is deprecated, it will be undefined
}

export default toNative(MyComponent)
```

### Remove `index-return-cons`

Remove `vue-facing-decorator/dist/index-return-cons`, you won't need this if `toNative` exists.

# What's new

* `createDecorator` has a preserve option. see docs.

* `v-model` sets event name in emits option now.
